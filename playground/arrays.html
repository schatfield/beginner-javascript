    //What is an array? A list of items where the order matters. Each thing in the array is called an item and it's position in the array is called the index. The number of items inside of an aray is called the length and each item can be any type- string, number, boolean, nested array, object, etc. 
    //they have indexes vs keys like objects have- but also arrays are objects because everything is.
    //zero based index positions- so the first item in the array is index position 0

//array literal syntax
  const names = ['wes', 'kait', 'snickers', 'last one'];
  console.log(names[1]);
  console.log(names.length);
  //this will return the item in the last index of the array. .length is looking at the whole length of it and -1 position from the end
  console.log(names[names.length -1]);

  //.push method - add items to the end of an array (mutates)
  names.push('lux');
  console.log(names);    
  //The immutable way to use .push: to avoid changing original array, take a copy of the original, make a new array with it. take a copy and update instead of "pushing" the change
  const names2 = [...names, 'lux'];
  
  //.unshift method to add items to the front of an array
  names.unshift('poppy');
  console.log(names);

  //the immutable way to use .unshift 

  const names3 = ['poppy', ...names];
  console.log(names3);







  //mutability vs Immutability with array methods
  //mutable methods perform mutations to data changing the orginal data
  //immutable methods do not change the original thing but return a new array with the change leaving the original array alone.

  //Mutable- DO change the original data. performs a mutation to the original data. 
 //const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
  //numbers.reverse();

  //.reverse mutable method in secondary variable
  //const numbersBackwards = numbers.reverse();
  //console.log(numbersBackwards);
  //this console.log shows us the the original data in the variable numbers has also been changed. making a secondary variable to store numbers.reverse() isn't necessary and won't keep the original data from being mutated.
  //console.log(numbers);

  //Immutable - do NOT change the original data

  //.slice method- let's us take a portion of the original array and turn that portion into our own new one

  //numbers.slice(2,4); this says take indexes 2-4 and return those items on those positions in a new array. it takes the 2nd and 3rd and STOPS, does not take the 4th(end is not included)
  
  //const pizzaSlice = numbers.slice(2,4);
  //console.log(pizzaSlice);
  
  //this console.log shows that the original array in the variable numbrs is NOT changed from it's original form
  //console.log(numbers);    

  //Anytime you want to use a mutation method and NOT change the original array
  //you need to take a copy of the array you want to change and then mutate the copy
  //spread operator making a copy of "numbers" and running.reverse on it
  //const numbersReversed = [...numbers].reverse();
  //if youb look at console.logs for "numbers" on lines 38 and 47, you see the opriginals are NOT changed but that line 54 is changed
  //console.log(numbersReversed);


    //.splice - taking something out of an array (mutates original array)
    //there's not start and end but a starting point and how many indexes should you go on for
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    //take out the item from the 3rd index position and go for 2 positions (remove 2 items). It should remove #'s 4 and 5.
    numbers.splice(3, 2);
    console.log(numbers);

    // console.log(numbers);
    // numbers.splice(3, 2);
    // console.log(numbers);

    // // Mutation Methods - DO CHANGE THE ORIGINAL DATA
    // const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    // // anytime you want to use a mutation method and NOT mutate the orignal array
    // // we need to take a copy of the array
    // const numbersReversed = [...numbers].reverse();
    // console.log(numbersReversed);
    // // numbers.reverse();
    // console.log(numbers);
    // // Immutable - THEY DO NOT CHANGE THE ORIGINAL DATA
    // const pizzaSlice = numbers.slice(2, 4);
    // console.log(pizzaSlice);
    // console.log(numbers);
