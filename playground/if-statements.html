  <h2>Truthy Values</h2>
  * 1
  * -10
  * full string - any string with content in it will be true
  * a string of "0"
  * empty array - unless you run .length on it and it returns 0 (0 is a falsey val)
  * empty object - works just like the array, if you want to check if anything is in the object you can use Object.keys

  <h2>Falsey Values</h2>
  * empty string
  * 0
  * undefined variable
  * Variable set to null
  * a variable set to `"hello" - 10` NaN

you can use Object.keys({}) to return an array
 
Just using Object.keys({}) will return to you an EMPTY array

 you can then run .length on that returned empty array like this 
 
 Object.keys({}).length which will equal 0 and then be falsey

We can also so do something like this :

Object.keys({ name: 'wes'})

"Object.keys" will give us all the properties on this object, in this case "name" is the property returned 

We then we can check for the length of that array 

Object.keys({ name: 'wes'}).length 

which would be equal to 1 because

this is a good way to get Truthy and Falsey out of Objects

/* Coercion

the bang operator twice !! can perform Coercion 

it's when we force a truthy or falsey value- something that's of a different type like a string or a number or an object, you can COERCE it to being a real boolean 

name = 'wes'

to check if there is no name do this:

!name  ?it will be false because there is a name?

Tp check if there is a name- is there as name TRUE or False

!!name (this is coercion) TRUE- there is a name and it's "wes"

it will coerce name into whether it exists or not

it is taking a truthy or falsey value and converting it to a boolean

here's a variable equal to an empty string (a FALSEY value)

middle
""
!middle
true

!!middle
false
