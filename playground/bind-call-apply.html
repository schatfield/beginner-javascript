  //bind , call, and apply - will change the scope of what the 'this' keyword is equal to inside of a function or method


// when method are called, the way that they get their 'this' value is they look to the left of the dot and see what they are bound against. 
//the sayHi method will give us the boject it was run against- which is person.
  const person = {

    }
  };
const jenna = { name: 'jenna'};

//take sayHi method and put it in it's own variable

//Bind: we can use the .bind to change what the 'this' keyword is equal to 

//the below says: create a function called sayHi, that when called it's 'this' keyword will be equal to whatever is passed into the .bind method
  const sayHi = person.sayHi.bind(jenna);
  
  //QS Example 

  const $ = document.querySelector;
