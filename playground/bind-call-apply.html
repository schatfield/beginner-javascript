  //bind , call, and apply - will change the scope of what the 'this' keyword is equal to inside of a function or method


// when method are called, the way that they get their 'this' value is they look to the left of the dot and see what they are bound against. 
//the sayHi method will give us the boject it was run against- which is person.
  const person = {
    name: 'shawna',
    sayHi() {
      console.log(this, 'this');
      console.log('hey');
      return `hey ${this.name}`;
    }
  };

const jenna = { name: 'jenna'};


//Bind: we can use the .bind to change what the 'this' keyword is equal to inside of a function or method

//the below says: create a function called sayHi, that when called it's 'this' keyword will be equal to whatever is passed into the .bind method
  const sayHi = person.sayHi.bind(jenna);
  
  //QS Example 
//by calling bind against document.querySelector, we say when the $ function is run use 'document' as the 'this' value
  const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document);
  const lookFor = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);

  const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper');
  const p = wrapper.querySelector('p');
  console.log(p);
  console.log($('p'));
  console.log('all p tags', lookFor('p'));

//you can also use bind to prep a function that has arguments pre loaded

const bill = {
  total: 1000,
  calculate(taxRate) {
    console.log(this, 'this');
    return this.total + (this.total *taxRate);
  }
}
const total = bill.calculate(0.20);
console.log(total);

//if i wanted to use this calculate function from the bill object and store it in an external variable:

const calculate = bill.calculate.bind(bill);
console.log(calculate(0.30));
